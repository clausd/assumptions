Assumptions.pm is a minimalist perl MVC framework based on DBI, DBIx::Abstract, CGI::Session and the Template Toolkit.

Documentation is somewhat sparse. Read the source.

I've used Assumptions on a number of projects

moon.classy.dk - Apollo 11 radio transcript reeneactment          (not currently running)
spotifydj.com -  The world's first Spotify internet DJing service (no longer operational)
classy.dk/jazz/setup.html - a calendar/Last.fm API-mashup generator		  (go have a look)

HOWTO

Follow the lead from the included test project.
1. Implement a module that inherits from Assumptions and implements a configure method (see ATest.pm)
2. Include this in a cgi script (see test.pl)
3. Use the included .htaccess as a template for your own .htaccess to activate the toolkit for your site
